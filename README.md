was first reported in December 2019., since then, COVID-19 spread to the whole world
and became a global pandemic. More than 200 countries were affected due to

imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, social distances, event postponements and
lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. However, due to lackadaisical attitude,
efforts attempted by the governments were jeopardised, thus, predisposing to the wide
spread of virus and lost of lives.
